My career with ZAB started back in 2010, and I have been a member here ever since. I have held numerous staff roles, from Webmaster to Training Administrator. If you are ever in need of my assistance, please do not hesitate to email me at austin@zabartcc.org.</p><p>If you are a brand new controller, I would highly recommend you take a few moments to prepare yourself for training. You should review the VATUSA training material, as well as our general policies on our website (https://zabartcc.org). Please also ensure your are familiar with the VATSIM CoC and CoR.</p><p>Your advancement through the training program is in your hands. My team will not push you to begin training, you must push yourself. Much of the training material is self-study, and you are expected to have gone over it before attending your first training session. Once you are ready to attend a training session, log into our website and navigate to the &quot;instructor availability&quot; area to view session that instructors are offering. Please keep in mind that all times on the website are listed in Zulu. Please convert to your local timezone.</p><p>Please keep in mind that all of the staff here are volunteers. You may find that instructors are not available when you are. You may also log into our Teamspeak server and if there are any instructors/mentors online, politely ask to coordinate a time to train.</p><p>If you wish to observe certified ZAB controllers when they are online (which I highly recommend you do), please ensure you are logging into VRC as &quot;ZAB_xx_OBS&quot;, where &quot;xx&quot; are your operating initials specified on the ZAB website.</p><p>You are encouraged to participate in our forums to keep up-to-date on the happenings around the ARTCC. You may register on the forums at any time, but please be sure that you register with your CID as your username. Using any other username will result in your registration being rejected.</p><p>Again, welcome to ZAB. I hope to see you online very soon!</p><p>Austin Robison<br />Air Traffic Manager<br />austin@zabartcc.org</p>',0),('ZAE','Academy','',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'','','','null',0,'zae','162.244.93.15','','','','',0),('ZAN','Anchorage ARTCC','http://www.vzanartcc.net',7,1115428,1067681,0,1354520,0,1282045,'http://www.vzanartcc.net/uls.php','','u7y3sHcjhwmaTeUq','{\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"use\":\"sig\",\"kty\":\"oct\",\"k\":\"CKLb3GBQkKtP7jL5NAvsTcv0evl8KBYRBQne6yhPOhgAa97jAzvqWiCLMSMutB2P4yC0PkX92QgOvM5BXm_nhA\"}',1,'9TDGwQUhpVWuZglp','','','','','<p>Hello %fname%,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My name is Daryl Hudnall, and on behalf of the entire ARTCC staff, welcome to the Anchorage ARTCC.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First, a few housekeeping issues. Within a matter of a couple of days, you should be added to the ARTCC website and forums. For the website you&#39;ll need to use your VATSIM CID and password through the VATSIM SSO/VATUSA ULS login process. The forums will require you to be logged into the website before they will grant access to all the areas. Should you not be able to access either the website or the forums after 48 hours of your acceptance please email staff@vzanartcc.net and let us know.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the things that may set us apart from other ARTCCs is the way in which we conduct training. Rather than the common method in which students submit training requests, and training staff pick up the requests at their leisure, you, the student, will schedule a session with an individual member of training staff, requiring you both to be ready to train at a specific time and date. Prior to your training sessions, you will be expected to complete the majority of your theory/knowledge portion of training on your own, and only meet with a trainer to:</p><p><br />1) review a failed VATUSA exam;<br />2) get time practicing on a position, either in a control simulator, or on a live scope;<br />3) complete an OTS (Over The-Shoulder) exam, to certify you for a position.</p><p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please remember that ALL written examinations MUST be completed with at least an 80% grade prior to beginning training for a given level. Once an exam is assigned you will have 21 days to complete so take your time and study the materials. As an example, prior to an OBS rated member beginning their first session on Delivery/Ground they must have met the above minimum grade on the VATUSA Student1 exam.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to schedule a start to your practical training, you should access our scheduling system by going to https://vzanartcc.setmore.com/. Contact our Training Administrator (ta@vzanartcc.net) if you have any issues scheduling training.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you haven&#39;t already, take a moment to look over the vast resources available on our website.

You can find the exam by navigating to the &quot;My VATUSA&quot; area on the main page of the VATUSA website. You must complete this exam before you can be added to our roster. If you do not score 100%, a staff member will be in contact with you. You will have 7 days from the date of the exam to submit corrections to any incorrect responses on the exam with details on where you found the correct answer. Once your exam has been corrected to 100% to the satisfaction of a staff member, you will be added to our roster.<br /><br />The exam is designed to check your ability to search through documents to find information and requires no deep knowledge of aviation or air traffic control. Think of it more like a scavenger hunt than an exam. Most material can be found on our website, (http://www.zauartcc.org). Feel free to use any other resources to complete the exam.<br /><br /><br />Once you are added to our roster, you will receive another email with important information on how to log into the website, the forums, and how to access controller training. You will be automatically registered for our forums as soon as you are added to our roster so do not register manually.<br /><br />In the meantime, below you will find our TeamSpeak server information.

My staff and I look forward to seeing you commence your training and join our wonderful controller corps.</p><p>Once you receive the ZMP website welcome, please check the roster on the ZMP website at http://www.minniecenter.org/roster&nbsp;and ensure that your name/CID/rating are all correct. Next to your name, you will see a set of operating initials. These are officially your identification within the facility and will be used for coordination and communication with other controllers, so please let me know if you would like something different than what you have been assigned. I will do my best to accommodate all requests for changes based on whatever initials we have available.</p><p>Secondly, watch your e-mail inbox for an e-mail from the VATUSA exam center notifying you of the assignment of the ZMP FAM (Familiarization) Exam. This is a quick open-book test on a few policies and procedures, all of which are available from our website Documents &amp; Procedures Area (http://minniecenter.org/documents). Once you successfully complete the FAM test, you will receive an email with your score. Anything less than 100%, you must log back into the VATUSA exam center, review your exam, and submit your corrections to our Training Administrator via email. He can be reached at: ta@minniecenter.org . In the email, please type the question(s) you answered incorrectly, your new answer(s) and where you found them. You will be given 30 days to complete the FAM, so avoid the urge to rush into completing it.</p><p>You may be grimacing at the idea of a test right off the bat, but please bear with us on this - we have proven over the years that a basic test to start proceedings allows us to better dedicate our limited training resources towards those individuals that are truly motivated towards becoming the best possible online controllers, and I sincerely hope that you fit that description. The most important piece of advice I can offer on the FAM is TAKE YOUR TIME and READ EVERYTHING CAREFULLY. The test isn&#39;t a race; there are no prizes for speed in Air Traffic Control!</p><p>ZMP maintains a Teamspeak 3 server for intra-facility communications and as a general gathering area. Please take a moment to download the TeamSpeak software from http://www.teamspeak.com. The server connection details are as follows:</p><p>Server Address: ts.minniecenter.org:9987<br />Nickname: YOUR FIRST/LAST NAME (e.g. John Smith)<br />Server Password: GoldEagle (pay attention to capitalization here)</p><p>Once you log in for the first time, one of the staff will register you with the server and you will be able to connect without the password on future connections. We use the server as a general area to socialize and gather on and off duty, so I encourage you to login and start getting to know your fellow controllers.</p><p>Once everything is done, feel free to start signing up for training sessions (under Controllers tab/Training System). Sign in with your CID and the password you set on our site. Under Students, select Add Request and select a time and date that works for you.<br /><br />I hope that ZMP proves to you over the coming weeks that it is indeed the facility that you set out to join (or visit), and I look forward to speaking with you soon. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments about ZMP or VATUSA ATC in general, please do not hesitate to raise them.
